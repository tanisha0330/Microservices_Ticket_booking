# TicketFlow Gateway — Locust Load Test Results

Date: 2026-08-30. Target: `http://localhost:8000` (the `gateway` service), plus
`http://localhost:8007` for the one journey step that the gateway does not
proxy (see below). Ran against the live 13-service docker-compose stack on
this machine, immediately after seeding the catalog (`python scripts/seed_data.py`
— the running stack had **no data at all** before this; see Findings).

Test code: `scripts/loadtest/locustfile.py`, deps in `scripts/loadtest/requirements.txt`.

## What was tested

Single `HttpUser` (`TicketFlowUser`) modeling one simulated ticket buyer:

- **`on_start`** (once per user): `POST /api/v1/auth/register`, falling back
  to `POST /api/v1/auth/login` on a 409 email collision.
- **`browse_catalog`** (weight 6, high): `GET /api/v1/events` (catalog list —
  see Findings, this is broken), then `GET /api/v1/events/{id}` and
  `GET /api/v1/events/{id}/seats` for a real seeded event.
- **`book_seat`** (weight 3, medium): `POST /api/v1/bookings/lock` for a
  random seat, then 70% of the time `POST /api/v1/bookings/{id}/confirm`
  (payment), 30% `POST /api/v1/bookings/{id}/release`.
- **`check_booking_status`** (weight 2, low/medium): `GET /api/v1/bookings/{id}`
  for a booking the same user made earlier.
- **`support_refund_or_inquiry`** (weight 1, low): `POST /api/v1/agent/chat`
  on **agent-gateway (:8007)**, asking for a refund or booking status. The
  `gateway` service (:8000) has no support-agent route at all — its routers
  are only `auth`, `events`, `bookings` (`services/gateway/app/main.py`,
  `services/gateway/app/routes/*.py`). support-agent itself
  (`services/support-agent/app/main.py`) calls `require_internal_secret(app)`
  globally, so it's mesh-only and not reachable from outside docker at all.
  agent-gateway's `/api/v1/agent/chat` is the actual externally-reachable,
  JWT-authenticated entry point that talks to support-agent internally —
  confirmed live before wiring it into the test.

`409` (seat already locked) and `429` (rate limited) are treated as expected,
successful outcomes throughout, not failures — both are the system behaving
correctly under contention/load. Real `5xx`s and connection failures are not.

## Findings — real, not tuned around

**1. `GET /api/v1/events` (catalog list) is broken end-to-end through the gateway. 100% failure rate in both runs, and it is a real bug, not a load artifact.**

`services/gateway/app/routes/events.py` proxies with
`target = f"{settings.catalog_service_url}/events"` — no trailing slash.
catalog-service's router is `APIRouter(prefix="/events")` with the list route
at `"/"`, i.e. the real path is `/events/`. FastAPI's `redirect_slashes`
therefore 307-redirects the gateway's own upstream call, and the `Location`
header it builds is an absolute URL using catalog-service's own host —
`http://catalog-service:8000/events/`, its **internal Docker-network
hostname**, which is unreachable from outside the compose network. Verified
directly:

```
$ curl -sD - "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/events/" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
location: http://catalog-service:8000/events/
```
Any real external client following that redirect gets a DNS/connection
failure (`gaierror(11001, 'getaddrinfo failed')` on this machine) — confirmed
by 155/155 and 198/198 failures across both runs. This is a genuine
production bug: nobody outside the docker network can list events through
the gateway at all, only fetch a single known event by ID. The single-item
routes (`/events/{id}`, `/events/{id}/seats`) don't have this issue (0
failures, both runs) because they don't hit the trailing-slash redirect.
Fix: change the proxy target to `f"{settings.catalog_service_url}/events/"`.

The remaining share of that endpoint's failures at 100 users (133/198) is
`429 Too Many Requests` — that's the second finding below, layering on top
of the redirect bug, not a separate issue.

**2. `429` rate limiting is working correctly and gets real exercise at 100 users.**

Per-IP limit is 300 req/min (`rate_limit_per_ip_per_minute` in
`services/gateway/app/config.py`); all 100 simulated users share one source
IP (`localhost`) in this test, so the shared per-IP bucket saturates well
before the per-user (100/min) bucket does. Every task in the locustfile
treats `429` as an expected, non-failure outcome, matching the instruction
to not penalize correct load-shedding — the only place `429` still shows as
a "failure" in the table above is the already-broken list endpoint, and it's
folded into that same 100%-failure line regardless.

**3. The rest of the system held up cleanly at both load levels: 0 unexpected failures.**

Register, login, event detail, seat map, seat lock, confirm, release, booking
status check, and the support-agent refund/inquiry path via agent-gateway
all had **zero** failures (excluding the expected 409/429 branches already
folded into "success") at both 20 and 100 concurrent users. `bookings/lock`
correctly 409s on contested seats without ever going 500. p95 latency for
the core booking path (lock/confirm/status) stayed under ~200ms even at 100
users; the visible tail spikes (~3.1s at the 95th+ percentile on `confirm`)
are single slow outliers (23 and 33 total requests respectively — a couple
of slow requests move the percentile a lot at this sample size), not a
sustained degradation.

**4. Two pre-existing bugs in `scripts/seed_data.py` were found and fixed to make this test possible at all** (not part of the load test scope, but load-bearing for it): its module docstring opened with `""` instead of `"""` (a real `SyntaxError`, the script could not run at all), and its hardcoded `DATABASE_URL` pointed at `localhost:5433`, which is not this stack's postgres port (`docker-compose.yml` maps it to `5440`) — so a first "successful" run silently wrote to an unrelated/nonexistent database and the actual stack stayed empty. Both fixed with one-line changes; noting here since running the test at all first required discovering that the running stack had zero seeded data.

## Chaos testing (pending)

No chaos-during-load run has been captured yet. `scripts/chaos_kill_broker.ps1`
and `scripts/chaos_kill_consumer.ps1` exist (see `docs/runbooks.md` for what
they do) but have not been executed as part of a load test in this session —
the live docker-compose stack needed to stay untouched for a parallel process.
Running one of them concurrently with a Locust run against 20 or 100 users is
a separate, still-pending step. No numbers are included here to avoid
fabricating a result that wasn't actually measured.

## Overall assessment

The core booking journey (browse a specific event, view seats, lock, confirm
or release, check status, and even the AI-agent refund flow) is solid under
both 20 and 100 concurrent users — no unexpected errors, reasonable
latencies, correct 409/429 behavior under contention. The one real defect
found is narrow but user-facing: the catalog *list* endpoint is completely
unusable through the gateway for any external client, which is a real bug
worth fixing (see Finding 1) independent of load.
